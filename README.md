App for tracking your sleep!

### Installation

Run the following command in terminal:
`npm install`

Then you need to use a Scss compiler like [sass.js.org/](https://sass.js.org/) to convert `/public/scss` to this directory `/public/css`. You need to make sure the bootstrap import in the correct location by specifying the file system.
